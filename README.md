# Hardware-Software Systems

Welcome to the Hardware-Software Systems repository! In this repository, we explore various aspects of hardware and software integration. Our work is divided into two main sections: `/atv` and `/labs`.

## `/atv`

In the `/atv` directory, you'll find a collection of smaller activities that cover a wide range of topics related to hardware-software systems. These activities are designed to provide a broad understanding of different concepts and techniques.

## `/labs`

The `/labs` directory is where we dive deeper into specific topics explored in the activities. Here, you'll find small projects that allow us to explore and apply the concepts in more detail. These projects provide hands-on experience and help reinforce the theoretical knowledge gained from the activities in `/atv`.
